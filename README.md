# Spring Boot with Kafka

This project demonstrates how to set up **Apache Kafka** in a **Spring Boot** environment, including a **provider** service and a **consumer** service for message transmission.

## 📌 Requirements

Before starting, make sure you have installed:

- Java 17+
- Apache Kafka
- Zookeeper
- Spring Boot 3.x
- Docker (optional)

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The code is organized as follows:
- Main project Springboot for kafka
- Service project to listen messages SpringBootConsumerApplication
- And service project for sending messages SpringBootProviderApplication

This version explicitly notes that `other.txt` contains the Kafka and Zookeeper terminal commands. Let me know if you need any additional refinements! 🚀
